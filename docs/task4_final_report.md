## 5. Ethics and Bias Considerations

### 5.1 Review Bias Notes

**Potential Biases Identified:**

1. **Negative Bias in Review Platforms**
   - Users with negative experiences are more likely to leave reviews than satisfied users
   - Estimated review bias: 2-3x more negative reviews than positive experiences
   - Impact: May overrepresent problems while underrepresenting satisfaction

2. **Selection Bias**
   - Only users who engage with Google Play Store review system are represented
   - May not represent all user demographics and usage patterns
   - Tech-savvy users may be overrepresented

3. **Recency Bias**
   - Recent experiences may be overrepresented in reviews
   - Historical performance improvements may not be reflected
   - Impact: Current issues may appear more severe than long-term trends

4. **Language Bias**
   - Analysis focuses on English-language reviews only
   - May not capture feedback from Amharic or other language speakers
   - Impact: Potential demographic bias

5. **Voluntary Response Bias**
   - Reviews are voluntary, not systematic sampling
   - Extremely satisfied or dissatisfied users more likely to respond
   - Impact: U-shaped distribution of sentiment

### 5.2 Mitigation Strategies

- **Complement with quantitative data:** App usage metrics, transaction success rates
- **Consider temporal trends:** Analyze review patterns over time
- **Cross-validate insights:** Compare with internal customer support data
- **Acknowledge limitations:** Use reviews as indicators, not absolute measures
- **Focus on themes:** Thematic patterns more reliable than individual review sentiment
